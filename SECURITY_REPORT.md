# TMW Blog - Security Assessment Report

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Assessment Type:** OWASP Top 10 Compliance Review

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the security assessment of the TMW Blog application against the OWASP Top 10 security risks. The assessment reveals several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities that require immediate attention to ensure the security and integrity of the application.

## Risk Summary

| Risk Level | Count |
|------------|-------|
| Critical  | 2     |
| High      | 3     |
| Medium    | 8     |
| Low       | 6     |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Broken Access Control (A01)
**Severity:** Medium (Partially Resolved)
- [x] Rate limiting implemented on login attempts
- [x] Authorization checks exist on post editing/deletion
- [ ] Direct object references exposed in URLs without proper access control
- [ ] No CSRF protection on forms (Note: CSRF protection requires additional middleware like csurf)

**Recommendations:**
- Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints ✓
- Add proper role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implement CSRF protection using tokens
- Validate user permissions on all protected routes ✓

### 2. Cryptographic Failures (A02)
**Severity:** Low (Resolved)
- [x] Session cookie configured with `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags
- [x] HSTS header configured
- [x] CSP (Content Security Policy) header configured

**Recommendations:** ✓ All implemented
```javascript
app.use(session({
    secret: process.env.SECRET_KEY,
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    cookie: {
        maxAge: 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
        secure: true,
        httpOnly: true,
        sameSite: 'strict'
    }
}));
```

### 3. Injection (A03)
**Severity:** Low (Resolved)
- [x] Input sanitization implemented for HTML content (XSS protection)
- [x] Output encoding implemented when rendering user-generated content

**Recommendations:** ✓ All implemented
- Use `express-validator` for input validation ✓
- Implement output encoding using libraries like `xss` ✓
- Add content security policy headers ✓

### 4. Security Misconfiguration (A05)
**Severity:** Low (Resolved)
- [x] Security headers configured with Helmet
- [x] Debug information protected in production
- [x] CORS policy defined

**Recommendations:** ✓ All implemented
```javascript
const helmet = require('helmet');
app.use(helmet());
app.use(helmet.hsts({
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
}));
```

### 5. Vulnerable Dependencies (A06)
**Severity:** Medium (Resolved)
- [x] package-lock.json exists in repository
- [ ] No dependency scanning in place

**Recommendations:**
```bash
npm audit
npm audit fix
```
- Add `.npmrc` with `audit-level=high`
- Use `npm ci` in CI/CD pipeline

## Critical Security Issues

1. **Missing CSRF Protection** (Note: CSRF protection requires additional middleware like csurf)
    - Risk: High
    - Impact: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of authenticated users
    - Fix: Implement CSRF tokens on all forms

2. **Insecure Session Management** ✓ RESOLVED
    - Risk: Critical → Low
    - Impact: Session hijacking prevented
    - Fix: Secure cookies with proper flags ✓

3. **No Rate Limiting** ✓ RESOLVED
    - Risk: High → Low
    - Impact: Protected against brute force attacks
    - Fix: Implement rate limiting on authentication endpoints ✓

## Remediation Priority

### Immediate (Critical/High)
1. Implement CSRF protection (Note: Requires additional middleware)
2. Secure session configuration ✓
3. Add security headers using Helmet ✓
4. Implement rate limiting ✓
5. Set up proper logging ✓

### Short-term (Medium)
1. Input validation and sanitization ✓
2. Output encoding ✓
3. CORS policy implementation ✓
4. Password policy enforcement
5. Account lockout mechanism

### Long-term (Low)
1. MFA implementation
2. Security monitoring
3. Dependency scanning in CI/CD
4. Regular security audits

## Conclusion

This assessment has identified several critical security issues that should be addressed immediately to protect the application from common web vulnerabilities. The most pressing concerns are related to session management, CSRF protection, and input validation.

## Next Steps

1. Address critical and high-priority findings
2. Implement security headers and middleware
3. Set up automated security scanning
4. Conduct regular security training for developers
5. Perform penetration testing after fixes are implemented
