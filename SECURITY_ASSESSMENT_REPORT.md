# TMW Blog - Security Assessment Report

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Assessed By**: Security Team  
**Version**: 1.0

## Executive Summary

This report outlines the security assessment of the TMW Blog application. The assessment focused on identifying potential security vulnerabilities and providing recommendations to enhance the overall security posture of the application.

## Assessment Scope

- Authentication & Session Management
- Input Validation & Output Encoding
- Database Security
- Error Handling
- Security Headers
- CSRF Protection
- API Security
- Dependencies
- Logging & Monitoring

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Authentication & Session Management

#### Vulnerabilities
- [x] Session cookies lack `secure`, `httpOnly`, and `sameSite` attributes → **RESOLVED**
- No account lockout mechanism after failed login attempts
- [x] Session timeout not properly configured → **RESOLVED** (30 days configured)
- [x] No password policy enforcement → **RESOLVED** (strong password requirements implemented)
- No multi-factor authentication

#### Risk Level: Medium (Reduced from High)

### 2. Input Validation & Output Encoding

#### Vulnerabilities
- [x] Missing input validation for user inputs (username, email, content) → **RESOLVED**
- [x] No protection against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in comments and post content → **RESOLVED**
- [x] No output encoding for dynamic content in EJS templates → **RESOLVED**

#### Risk Level: Low (Reduced from High)

### 3. Database Security

#### Vulnerabilities
- Connection pool configuration repeated in multiple files
- No connection timeout settings
- No query timeout configuration

#### Risk Level: Medium

### 4. Error Handling

#### Vulnerabilities
- Detailed error messages and stack traces exposed in production
- Inconsistent error handling across routes
- No centralized error handling mechanism

#### Risk Level: Medium

### 5. Security Headers

#### Vulnerabilities
- [x] Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) → **RESOLVED**
- [x] Missing X-Content-Type-Options → **RESOLVED**
- [x] Missing X-Frame-Options → **RESOLVED**
- [x] Missing X-XSS-Protection → **RESOLVED**
- [x] Missing Referrer-Policy → **RESOLVED**

#### Risk Level: Low (Reduced from High)

### 6. CSRF Protection

#### Vulnerabilities
- No CSRF tokens in forms (Note: csurf package is deprecated; alternative middleware needed)
- No protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks

#### Risk Level: High (Unchanged - requires additional middleware)

### 7. API Security

#### Vulnerabilities
- [x] No input validation on API parameters → **RESOLVED**
- [x] No rate limiting on API endpoints → **RESOLVED** (rate limiting implemented)
- [x] No authentication for some endpoints → **RESOLVED** (requireAuth middleware in place)

#### Risk Level: Low (Reduced from High)

### 8. Dependencies

#### Vulnerabilities
- Outdated dependencies with potential known vulnerabilities
- No dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline

#### Risk Level: Medium

### 9. Logging & Monitoring

#### Vulnerabilities
- [x] Insufficient security event logging → **PARTIALLY RESOLVED** (Morgan logging implemented)
- No audit logging for sensitive actions
- No monitoring for suspicious activities

#### Risk Level: Low (Reduced from Medium)

## Risk Summary

| Risk Level | Count |
|------------|-------|
| High       | 1     |
| Medium     | 3     |
| Low        | 5     |

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **CSRF Protection** (Still High Priority)
    - Add CSRF tokens to all forms
    - Implement CSRF protection middleware (csurf deprecated - need alternative)

### Completed Actions (Previously High Priority)

2. **Implement Secure Session Configuration** ✓
    - Add `secure`, `httpOnly`, and `sameSite` attributes to session cookies ✓
    - Implement proper session timeout ✓
    - Regenerate session ID after login

3. **Input Validation & Output Encoding** ✓
    - Implement server-side input validation ✓
    - Use output encoding for all dynamic content ✓
    - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) ✓

4. **Security Headers** ✓
    - Implement security headers using Helmet.js ✓
    - Configure a strict Content Security Policy ✓

### Short-term Actions (Medium Priority)

1. **Database Security**
    - Centralize database connection configuration
    - Implement connection timeouts
    - Add query timeouts

2. **Error Handling**
    - Implement centralized error handling
    - Custom error pages for different error types
    - Sanitize error messages in production

3. **Rate Limiting** ✓
    - Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints ✓
    - Add API rate limiting ✓

### Long-term Actions

1. **Authentication Enhancements**
    - Implement multi-factor authentication
    - [x] Enforce strong password policies ✓
    - Implement account lockout after failed attempts

2. **Monitoring & Logging**
    - [x] Implement comprehensive logging ✓ (Morgan implemented)
    - Set up security monitoring
    - Regular security audits

3. **Dependency Management**
    - Regularly update dependencies
    - Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD
    - Remove unused dependencies

## Conclusion

The TMW Blog application has significantly improved its security posture since the initial assessment. Major vulnerabilities in authentication, input validation, session management, security headers, and API security have been resolved. The remaining high-risk item (CSRF protection) requires alternative middleware since the previously recommended package is deprecated. Regular security assessments should continue to ensure the ongoing security of the application.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Address the remaining CSRF protection vulnerability using alternative middleware
2. **Short-term**: Implement centralized error handling and database connection improvements
3. **Medium-term**: Add account lockout mechanism and enhanced monitoring
4. **Long-term**: Implement MFA and regular dependency updates
5. Schedule a security review after implementing the remaining changes
6. Establish a regular security assessment schedule
7. Train the development team on secure coding practices
